Description: Video metadata cleaner
 cattywampus is a command-line tool for removing unwanted metadata from video
 files. It supports MKV files (using MKVToolNix) and MP4/M4V files (using
 AtomicParsley).
 .
 Key features:
  * Clean metadata from MKV, MP4, and M4V video files
  * Support for batch processing of directories
  * Configurable via TOML configuration files
  * Cross-platform support for Linux, macOS, and Windows
  * File manager integration for easy right-click access

 The tool automatically detects available external tools (mkvtoolnix and
 atomicparsley) and processes files accordingly. It can be used both as a
 command-line utility and through file manager context menus.
